... website? blog? As I deploy this into the wild I will document whats going on here.

## Technology used

I wanted a super simple website that is easy to maintain and easy to add content to. My searches started looking around for static website generators (I don't believe a simple blog needs a database and all that jazz) and stumbled upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) whose [Github README](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) describes it as 

> A Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built with love by [bep](https://github.com/bep), [spf13](http://spf13.com/) and [friends](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors) in [Go][https://golang.org/].

Which immediately ticked a few boxes for me being a Go fan. I dived right in following the [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and was up and running in a couple of minutes.

Note: This is a work in progress.
